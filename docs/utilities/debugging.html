    There are a couple of useful CSS debugging utilities built into the system.
  </p>


  <h3 class="code f5">.debug</h3>
  <div class="debug">
    <p class="measure lh-copy">
      The debug_children module allows you to use a class called "debug" on any element. That element along with any child node will have an outline of 1px solid gold placed on it.
    </p>
    <div class="flex justify-between mw6">
      <span class="w3 h3 bg-green br-100"></span>
      <span class="w3 h3 bg-gold br-100"></span>
      <span class="w3 h3 bg-red br-100"></span>
    </div>

    <h3 class="code f5">.debug_grid</h3>

  </div>
  <p class="measure lh-copy">
    The debug grid module allows you to put a background grid on any element which can help you line elements up vertically and horizontally with eachother. Sometimes across large amounts of whitespace it can be tough to see if things are aligned. The background
    grid comes in both 8 and 16px columns.

  <div class="debug-grid pa2 pa4-ns">
    <h1 class="outline lh-solid f1 f-headline-l fw6 mt0 mb4">The Grid</h1>
    <h2 class="outline lh-solid f2 f-subheadline-l fw4 mv0">&amp; the Graphic Designer</h1>
        <p class="outline lh-copy measure f3">
          For us Graphic Design is “organization of information.” There are other types of graphic design more concerned with illustration or of a narrative nature.
        </p>
        <p class="outline lh-copy measure f4">
          Nothing could be more useful to reach our intention than the Grid. The grid represents the basic structure of our graphic design, it helps to
          organize the content, it provides consistency, it gives an orderly look and it projects a level of intellectual elegance that we like to express.
        </p>
        <p class="outline lh-copy measure f5">
          ahere are infinite kinds of grids, but just one - the most
          appropriate - for any problem. Therefore, it becomes important to
          know which kind of grid is the most appropriate. The basic
          understanding is that the smaller the module of the grid the least
          helpful it could be. We could say that an empty page is a page with
          an infintesimal small grid. Therefore, it is equivalent to not
          being there. Conversely a page with a coarse grid is a very
          restricting grid offering too few alternatives. The secret is to
          nd the proper kind of grid for the
          job at hand.
