      <h3 class="futura-heavy">Don't write CSS, Compose Classes</h3>
      <p class="mb5 measure lh-copy">
        The Design System is extremely flexible and powerful. 90% of interface solutions can be composed from the base utility classes, making our CSS small and DRY, and avoids the common pattern of authoring more and more CSS per feature.
      </p>

      <div class="bg-gold br-100 flex h4 items-center justify-center mh2 w4">
        <span class="f1 pa2 ttu white">8%</span>
      </div>

      <h3 class="futura-heavy">Add new classes to Libraries</h3>
      <p class="mb5 measure lh-copy">If you find it's not serving your needs, then the next step is to contribute a reusable utility to the library. This way, other teams can use it in their project and get the benefit of your solutions.</p>

      <div class="bg-red br-100 flex h4 items-center justify-center mh2 tc w4">
        <span class="f1 pa2 ttu white">2%</span>

      <h3 class="futura-heavy">Write Custom CSS</h3>
      <p class="mb5 measure lh-copy">Finally, you can write custom CSS per project. It's strongly suggested you try to solve the problem with this system first. This reduces repetion of code/work, reduces hard to replicate bugs, and increases consistency of the Fender brand/design language.</p>
